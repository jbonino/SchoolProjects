define local variables

(let //scope is in let definition
  ((var1 0 )
  (var2 0)))
scope of vars is the form which they appear.

for(let i=0;i<9;i++){

} //creates new i for each function closure. easier

enter:(map cdr family)
return:'(fred wilma)

You can use this to make a function linear time compared to polynomial time.

Abstract Data Types---da Fuck?
