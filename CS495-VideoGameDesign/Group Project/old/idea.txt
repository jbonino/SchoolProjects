We want to design a endless 2d runner. Their would be a giant wave
displaying on the screen where you play as a surfer riding the wave.
You will be dodging coral, snorkelers, sharks, octopi, garbage, etc.
There is no way to win the game other then get a higher score then yourself
or another player.
