--->RUBIKS CUBE
paste 1/9 the image onto an area slightly smaller then 1/9 the face
-For black lines ^^^^

Draw a black cube first, then draw 54 little pictures but dont draw them on
the cube, draw slightly off the cube

depth testing-
draw 6 sides seperate with double loop

3 dimensional array
keep track of where little square is and the way its facing.
21 stickers affected by rotation
-1 changes orientation and not position
-20 move around

(6)	(3)	(3)
side	row	col

array of obj: Picture (1-6)
row and col of "ninth of pic"
 ^-(0-3)-^
for angle (0-90-180-270)
27 cubes

--->GROUP PROJECT NOTES 9/16/2015

FRAMES 24/sec
-Each Frame should only include a single motion. Focus on frogger, not cars
-Anticipated Motion. The animation that happens before the important thing
-Exagerated Motion. Not all animation is realistic

DRAWING EVERY FRAME
-Backgrounds- Scenery
-Things can move around on essentially stationary background. Or background that moves in a stedier predictable way

INBETWEENER
-Draw a starting config <------MAIN-----> ending config. Use math for main

ANIMATION LOOPS
-You can repeat stuff

PANNING IMAGES
-Background. Large image that you show pieces of.

Realistic or Unrealisitc
